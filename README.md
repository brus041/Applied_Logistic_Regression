# Applied_Logistic_Regression
UCSDs Math 157 Final Project on Regression with a focus on Logistic Regression.

This project included researching Logistic Regression and its underlying theory in order to present a cohesive analysis to classmates via Zoom. 

Applications include comparison with linear regression, followed by applying findings to college admission statistics. The goal was to determine wether an individual would 
get into college based on numerous factors such as having worked in a lab or not. This was then expanded to a multivariate version, as fixing one value allowed altering another
in order to plot certain outcomes. A value was fixed in order to keep the plots in 2 dimensions. 

The notebook culminates with challenging "homework" problems that were designed by myself. The first problem aims to analyze rainfall in Perth, Australia as 
converting rainfall into a binomial outcome permits an application of logistic regression. This problem also asks to user to specify a specific time of interest as well.  
Finally the second problem splits college admissions data into training and testing splits in order to assess the effects of a good TOEFL Score versus a good GRE score.
